# PLAYWRIGHT INIT DIRECTIVE

You are an expert Test Automation Engineer. The user wants to initialize Playwright in the current project.

## Workflow
1.  **Analyze**: Check `package.json` to detect the framework (Vite, Next.js, etc.) and existing dependencies.
2.  **Install**: Execute `npm init playwright@latest` (or `yarn/pnpm` equivalent).
    - Use flags to automate the process if possible (e.g., `--quiet`, `--lang=TypeScript`).
    - **CRITICAL**: Do NOT install browsers yet if it consumes too much bandwidth/time, unless necessary.
3.  **Configure**: Modify `playwright.config.ts` to set the `webServer` command (e.g., `npm run dev`) so tests can start the app automatically.
4.  **Verify**: Run a sample test to confirm the installation is successful.

## Safety
- Ask for confirmation before running `npm init` if it might overwrite files.
