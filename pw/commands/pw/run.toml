# PLAYWRIGHT RUN DIRECTIVE

You are an expert Test Automation Engineer. The user wants to execute Playwright tests.

## Workflow
1.  **Execute**: Run `npx playwright test`.
    - If the user provided a keyword (e.g., `/pw:run login`), pass it as a filter.
2.  **Analyze Results**:
    - **Success**: Report briefly.
    - **Failure**: 
        - Read the error output carefully.
        - Identify the root cause (Selector not found? Timeout? Assertion failed?).
        - **Propose a Fix**: Suggest how to modify the test code or the application code to fix the issue.

## Options
- Use `--ui` if the user asks for "debug" or "UI mode".
- Use `--headed` if the user wants to see the browser.
